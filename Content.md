About us

Hi Talent is an online programming training platform that is on a mission to help students and working professionals brush up their skills free of cost. We deliver our training through an internship of 3 or 6 months, which equips the talents with basic programming skills. With us, the talents have a chance to try their hands on live projects. We are sure that our internship program helps the talents to update their programming skills according to current industry standards. 
We are delivering training in Java, Python, Javascript, SQL, Docker, Algorithms, .NET, Agile, DevOps, and basic data structure.
