**About us**

Hi Talent is an online programming training platform that is on a mission to help students learn programming free of cost. 
We deliver our training through  internship of 3-6 months(for those who are from computer science discipline) duration and apprenticeship of 6-9 months(for those who are from other discipline), which equips the talents with programming skills. The end goal is that after the internship or apprenticeship, the talent will be able to get a job as a software developer. 
With us, the talents have a chance to try their hands on live projects, which helps them to get real work experience. We are sure that our internship program helps the talents to update their programming skills according to current industry standards. 
We are delivering training in Java, Python, Javascript, SQL, Docker, Algorithms, .NET, Agile, DevOps, and basic data structure.
